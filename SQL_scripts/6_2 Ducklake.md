# Section 6: Setting Up Duck Lake with S3 and MotherDuck

## Step 1. Create an S3 Bucket
1. In the AWS console, search for **S3** and open the service.  
2. Click **Create bucket**.  
3. Fill out:  
   - **Bucket name**: Must be globally unique (e.g., `ducklake-andreas-001`)  
   - **AWS Region**: Pick the region you want (e.g., `us-east-1` or `eu-central-1`)  
   - **Block Public Access**: Keep all checkboxes enabled (recommended)  
4. Leave other defaults unless you have special needs (like encryption, versioning).  
5. Click **Create bucket**.  

---

## Step 2. Create the IAM User
1. Go to **IAM â†’ Users â†’ Add users**.  
2. Enter a username (e.g., `ducklake-user`).  
3. On the **Set permissions** screen, either:  
   - Attach **AmazonS3FullAccess** directly (for testing), or  
   - Create a custom policy scoped to your bucket (recommended).  

ðŸ‘‰ At this point, the user exists, but has no access keys yet.  

### Step 2.1. Attach Permissions to the User
- In the IAM creation flow, choose **Attach policies directly**.  
- Start with **AmazonS3FullAccess** for testing.  
- Later, restrict access to just your Duck Lake bucket. Example custom policy:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:*"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::ducklake-andreas-001",
        "arn:aws:s3:::ducklake-andreas-001/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Attach this policy to the user.  

---

## Step 3. Create Access Keys for the User
1. Go to **IAM â†’ Users â†’ ducklake-user**.  
2. Open the **Security credentials** tab.  
3. Scroll down to **Access keys** â†’ Click **Create access key**.  
4. Select **Application running outside AWS**.  
5. AWS generates:  
   - **Access Key ID**  
   - **Secret Access Key** (shown only once â€” save securely).  

---

## Step 4. Collect Connection Info
You now have:  
- Access Key ID âœ…  
- Secret Access Key âœ…  
- Region (e.g., `us-east-1`) âœ…  
- Endpoint (`https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`) âœ…  

Thatâ€™s all DuckDB/MotherDuck needs to talk to your bucket.  

---

## Step 5. Set Credentials
- Go to **MotherDuck â†’ Secrets**  
- Set secret `ducklake` and test it.  

---

## Step 6. Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_ducklake (
  TYPE DUCKLAKE,
  DATA_PATH 's3://ducklake-andreas-001/nyc/'
);
```

---

## Step 7. Copy Table into Duck Lake
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_ducklake.main.clean_requests AS
SELECT *
FROM course_demo.main.clean_requests;
```

---

## Step 8. Query Yearly Complaints
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS complaints
FROM my_ducklake.main.clean_requests
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

---

## Step 9. Insert a New Record
```sql
INSERT INTO my_ducklake.main.clean_requests (
  unique_key,
  created_date,
  closed_date,
  agency,
  agency_name,
  complaint_type,
  descriptor,
  location_type,
  incident_zip,
  incident_address,
  street_name,
  cross_street_1,
  cross_street_2,
  intersection_street_1,
  intersection_street_2,
  address_type,
  city,
  landmark,
  facility_type,
  status,
  due_date,
  resolution_description,
  resolution_action_updated_date,

  x_coordinate_state_plane_,
  y_coordinate_state_plane_,
  open_data_channel_type,
  park_facility_name,
  park_borough,
  vehicle_type,
  taxi_company_borough,
  taxi_pick_up_location,
  bridge_highway_name,
  bridge_highway_direction,
  road_ramp,
  bridge_highway_segment,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  location,
  closed_in_days
)

);
```

---

## Step 10. Verify Insert
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS complaints
FROM my_ducklake.main.clean_requests
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

---

## Step 11. Clean Up
```sql
DROP TABLE my_ducklake.main.clean_requests;
```
